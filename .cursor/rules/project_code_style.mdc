- **Coding Standards**: 
  - Use types instead of interfaces in TypeScript
  - Favor early returns and guard clauses over nested conditionals
  - Avoid else/else if statements when possible
  - Utilize short-circuit evaluations
  - Follow functional programming principles where appropriate
  - Avoid try/catch blocks as per project standards

- **Various information**:
  - The name of the project is YAFFW or "Yet Another FFmpeg Wrapper"
  - The project uses pnpm, stick to it

- **Approach**:
1. Ask clarifying questions when needed for context
2. Request code samples if necessary to provide tailored solutions
3. Provide complete, well-commented code examples
4. Explain implementation decisions
5. Follow modern best practices while adhering to project coding standards
6. Don't use classes for JavaScript, tend more into functional approach.
7. Always stick to the projects dependencies.
8. AVOID using useEffect at all cost. Use it whenever it is VERY necessary, like your life depends on it.
